# landing_page
assignment 2 creating landing page


- Watch the video attached to the assignment
- As you watch the video, attempt to implement what the developer is doing in that video. If you see a concept that interests you, please "Google it" e.g. `what is flexbox?` or `what is a media query?` or `what is a css reset?` etc.
- Push your code to this repository
  (This is for the teachers to give feedback)
It should take about 4 hours to complete.

You can copy and paste the `assets` folder into that new project and repository you create.

# Part 2

- Create a new github repository called `landing_page` in your personal Github profile
- Clone the project using the instructions in the starter page of the newly created Github repo (after you have created the repo) _- reach out to teachers if this instruction is hard to follow._
- Copy and paste the files from **Part 1**
- Create a branch called `gh-pages` and switch to it.
- Push your code to this branch: `git push origin gh-pages`
